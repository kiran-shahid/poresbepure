                    <h2>Oily Skin</h2>
                    <p>Oily skin is characterized by an overproduction of sebum, resulting in a shiny complexion and enlarged pores. It is more prone to acne breakouts due to excess oil production. The skin may have a greasy and slick appearance throughout the day. Oily skin can be caused by various factors, including genetics, hormonal changes, and environmental factors. Proper skincare for oily skin involves regular cleansing to remove excess oil and using non-comedogenic products to prevent clogged pores.</p>
                    <p>Common issues associated with oily skin include acne breakouts, blackheads, whiteheads, and an overall oily and shiny appearance. It is important to maintain a consistent skincare routine tailored to oily skin to control oil production and keep the skin balanced and healthy.</p>

                    <h2>Dry Skin</h2>
                    <p>Dry skin is characterized by a lack of moisture and can feel tight, rough, and flaky. It may appear dull and have a tendency to develop fine lines and wrinkles. Dry skin is often caused by factors such as genetics, aging, harsh weather conditions, and excessive use of drying skincare products. Individuals with dry skin may experience discomfort, itching, and a feeling of tightness after cleansing.</p>
                    <p>Common issues associated with dry skin include dry patches, flakiness, and a lack of natural glow. It is essential to maintain a well-hydrated and nourished skin barrier by using hydrating skincare products, avoiding harsh cleansers, and incorporating moisturizers rich in emollients and humectants.</p>

                    <h2>Combination Skin</h2>
                    <p>Combination skin is characterized by having both oily and dry areas on the face. Typically, the T-zone (forehead, nose, and chin) tends to be oily, while the cheeks and other areas may be dry or normal. Combination skin can be challenging to manage as it requires a balance between treating the oily areas without drying out the dry areas.</p>
                    <p>Common issues associated with combination skin include a shiny T-zone, enlarged pores, occasional breakouts in oily areas, and dryness or tightness in other areas. It is important to use gentle cleansers, moisturize the dry areas, and use targeted treatments for specific concerns in different parts of the face.</p>

                    <h2>Normal Skin</h2>
                    <p>Normal skin is considered the ideal skin type, with balanced sebum production and a healthy complexion. It is characterized by a smooth and even texture, good elasticity, and a natural radiance. Normal skin has well-moisturized and adequately functioning sebaceous glands.</p>
                    <p>Common issues associated with normal skin are minimal compared to other skin types. However, maintaining a good skincare routine is still essential to keep the skin healthy and prevent future problems. Regular cleansing, moisturizing, and sun protection are key steps in caring for normal skin.</p>
